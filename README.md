In this project we will use the basic block level element 
lik div, and SVGâ€™s for creating the structure of the project management dashboard 
using the div tag selector we will create the container for our project 
then using the < h1> tag selector we will add the heading and using the svg we will add the graphics inside our project which to provide a dynamic link. We will also add some dynamic buttons inside our project to manage all the desired tasks.
